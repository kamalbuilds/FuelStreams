# RWA Tokenization

## Real-World Assets on Fuel Network

### What are RWAs?
Real-World Assets (RWAs) are physical or traditional financial assets tokenized on blockchain:
- Real estate properties
- Government bonds
- Corporate bonds
- Commodities (gold, oil, etc.)
- Private credit
- Intellectual property

### FuelStreams RWA Innovation

#### Streaming Yields
Unlike traditional RWAs that pay quarterly/annually, FuelStreams enables:
- **Real-time yield distribution** (every second)
- **Automatic reinvestment** for compound growth
- **Fractional ownership** starting from $1

#### Example: Real Estate Token
```sway
struct RealEstateToken {
    property_id: str[32],
    total_value: u64,
    annual_rent: u64,
    token_supply: u64,
    last_distribution: u64,
}

fn distribute_rent() {
    let rent_per_second = annual_rent / (365 * 24 * 3600);
    // Stream to all token holders proportionally
    for holder in token_holders {
        let share = holder.tokens / total_supply;
        stream_payment(holder.address, rent_per_second * share);
    }
