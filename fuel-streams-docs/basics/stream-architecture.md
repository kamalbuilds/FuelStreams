# Stream Architecture

## How FuelStreams Works Under the Hood

### Core Architecture
```
User Intent → AI Processing → Smart Contract Generation → Fuel Network Execution
```

### Stream Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: User/AI defines stream parameters
2. **Validation**: Smart contract validates conditions
3. **Execution**: Funds flow based on time/conditions
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time tracking and alerts
5. **Completion**: Automatic cleanup when finished

### Technical Components

#### Stream Contract
```sway
contract PaymentStream {
    storage {
        streams: StorageMap<u64, StreamData>,
        stream_count: u64,
    }
    
    fn create_stream(
        recipient: Address,
        rate: u64,
        duration: u64
    ) -> u64 {
        // Create and store stream
        let stream_id = storage.stream_count.read();
        storage.streams.insert(stream_id, StreamData {
            sender: msg_sender(),
            recipient,
            rate,
            start_time: timestamp(),
            end_time: timestamp() + duration,
            withdrawn: 0,
        });
        stream_id
    }
}
```

#### Parallel Processing
- Each stream operates independently (UTXO model)
- No global state conflicts
- 10,000+ concurrent streams possible

#### Gas Optimization
- Batch withdrawals for efficiency
- Predictable costs (<$0.01 per operation)
- AI-optimized execution patterns

### Security Model
- Multi-signature governance
- Time-locked upgrades
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- Formal verification of critical paths
