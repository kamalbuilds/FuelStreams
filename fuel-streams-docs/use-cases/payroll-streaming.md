# Payroll Streaming

## Revolutionary Employee Compensation

### The Problem with Traditional Payroll
- Employees wait 2-4 weeks for payment while providing immediate value
- 78% live paycheck-to-paycheck due to timing mismatches
- Cash flow stress leads to poor financial decisions
- Complex payroll administration for employers
