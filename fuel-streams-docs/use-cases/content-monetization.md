# Content Monetization

## Revolutionary Creator Economy

### Traditional Creator Struggles
- **Platform Dependency**: YouTube, Twitch take 30-50% revenue share
- **High Thresholds**: Need 1000+ subscribers to monetize
- **Delayed Payments**: 30-60 day payment cycles
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Limited monetization in many countries
- **Algorithm Risk**: Platform changes can destroy income overnight

### FuelStreams Creator Revolution

#### Direct Fan Relationships
```
Traditional: Creator → Platform → Audience (Platform takes 30-50%)
FuelStreams: Creator ↔ Audience (Direct, <5% fees)
```

#### Instant Monetization
```
Traditional: Need 1000+ subscribers → Apply for monetization → Wait weeks → Maybe approved
FuelStreams: Publish content → Monetize immediately → Get paid per view
```

### Monetization Models

#### 1. Micro-Payment Per Consumption
```typescript
const contentStream = await CreatorStreams.setupContent({
  creator: "0xCreator123",
  contentType: "article",
  pricePerView: "0.10", // $0.10 per read
  pricePerMinute: "0.05", // $0.05 per minute watched
  tipEnabled: true
});

// Readers pay micro-amounts as they consume
// Creator earns in real-time
```

#### 2. Subscription Streaming
```typescript
const subscription = await CreatorStreams.createSubscription({
  creator: "0xCreator123",
  tiers: [
    { 
      name: "Basic", 
      price: "5", // $5/month
      benefits: ["All articles", "Community access"]
    },
    { 
      name: "Premium", 
      price: "15", // $15/month
      benefits: ["All content", "Direct chat", "Early access"]
    }
  ],
  streamingPayments: true // Pay only when creator publishes
});
```

#### 3. Performance-Based Revenue
```sway
contract PerformanceMonetization {
    fn calculate_creator_payment(
        content_id: u64,
        engagement_score: u64,
        time_spent: u64,
        shares: u64
    ) -> u64 {
        let base_payment = get_base_rate(content_id);
        let engagement_bonus = engagement_score * 10;
        let time_bonus = time_spent * 5;
        let viral_bonus = shares * 25;
        
        base_payment + engagement_bonus + time_bonus + viral_bonus
    }
}
```
