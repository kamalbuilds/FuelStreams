# FuelStreams - Real-Time Asset Streaming Protocol 🌊⚡

## Overview

FuelStreams is a next-generation real-time asset streaming and micro-payment infrastructure built on Fuel Network. It combines Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, privacy-preserving payment flows, and innovative streaming payment mechanisms to create a comprehensive financial streaming ecosystem.

## 🎯 Core Innovation

Leveraging Fuel's 1-second block time and parallel execution capabilities, FuelStreams enables:

- **Continuous Payment Streams**: Real-time salary, subscription, and yield payments
- **RWA Asset Streaming**: Tokenized real-world assets with streaming income distribution
- **Privacy-Preserving Flows**: Zero-knowledge payment streams for confidential transactions
- **Micro-Payment Infrastructure**: Ultra-low cost payments for content, services, and utilities
